    </ul>
<p><h2><em>Steps:</em></h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut bottom shell of lobster tails using kitchen shears along each side where it meets the top shell; do not remove the shell at this point. </li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place lobster tails cut side down in the butter. Cook, covered, about 3 minutes. Turn lobster tails over (they are curved so will lean to 1 side); cover and cook 1 minute. Lean them to the other side; cover and cook 1 minute more.

        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Transfer lobster tails to a bowl. Remove any shell pieces from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Place 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat;
            add shallots and pinch of salt. Cook and stir until pan starts to deglaze and shallots soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add mushrooms;
            cook stir until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Add flour; stir until mushrooms are coated and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in cognac;
            use a kitchen torch to flame cognac to burn off alcohol. This will take just a few seconds. Add milk; cook and stir until pan is completely deglazed and milk begins to thicken and turn bubbly,
            about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in creme fraiche. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Remove lobster meat from the shell, leaving top shell intact. Remove any bits of bottom shell from the meat.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking pan with crinkled up foil. Make 4 channel-like indentations in the foil to hold and stabilize the lobster tails as they bake.</li>
        <li>Slice lobster meat down the middle and check for and remove any dark veins. Chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer meat to a mixing bowl. Add cooled sauce, tarragon, pinch of salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir gently until well blended.

        </li>
        <li>Divide mixture among the lobster tail shells; place in prepared foil-lined pan. Sprinkle each lobster tail with about 1/2 teaspoon bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon grated cheese. Drizzle melted butter on the stuffed shells.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until nicely browned and heated through, about 10 minutes. If you like, you can turn on the broiler and broil 1 minute until tops are golden and crispy.</li>
    </ol>
